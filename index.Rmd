# MalCon {-}

As part of the Global Fund supports since 2008, the Papua New Guinea Institute of Medical Research (PNGIMR) has established the malaria control section (MalCon) under its Population Health and Demography Unit (PHDU) that conducts a range of operational research and evaluation activities in support of the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP). These activities contribute to generating evidence on the outcome and impacts of the Global Fund supported malaria control activities and inform the NMCP on the dynamics of malaria epidemiology across PNG and better malaria control intervention strategies. 

Since 2008, MalCon has been conducting a series of two repeated countrywide cross-sectional surveys, namely, Health facility survey (HFS) and malaria indicator survey (MIS). Five rounds of HFS have been completed to date: two In the two years (2010, 2011) prior to the implementation of the new National Malaria Treatment Protocol (NMTP) and three afterwards (2012, 2014, 2016). Another round is conducted in 2021-2022 and still ongoing. 

In the frame of the continuous comprehensive evaluation of the NMCP, MalCon has also accomplished five rounds of MIS between 2008 and 2020 and the sixth round is planned to commence in mid 2022.  

## Disclaimer

This document has been written for the staff in the Malaria Control section (MalCon) at PNGIMR. As a result, it includes MalCon-specific terms and refers to internal documents that are only accessible to MalCon staff. As these procedures have been prepared for the use of MalCon staff, other users may require authorisation or caveats may apply.

Also note that this is a working document and still in development phase. 


# Purpose and Scope 

The surveys and other activities undertaken by the MalCon involves regularly recurring field operations which will benefit from standardizing the procedures and processes involved. It would largely benefit the MalCon project to develop a clear and guiding standard operating procedure manual as a reference document for the management of these field operations as well as for scientific technical activities. 

Hence, this document is comprised of two major sections: Managment SOP and technical SOP. 

# Management SOP

# Technical SOP 

## Health Facility Survey (HFS)


## Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) 

A nation-wide malaria indictor survey (MIS) is carried out in Papua New Guinea (PNG) every two years to evaluate the outcome and impact of the malaria control measures using specific indicators. 




### Village sampling methods

MIS report in 2018 shows a difference in malaria prevalence between the surveyed villages below and above 1600 meters, 7.1% and 0.9%, respectively. A well-documented observation in PNG is that altitude shapes malaria distribution. Therefore, it is recommended to sample more villages in low altitudes within the seven Highlands provinces.

This section describes procedures to generate three lists of randomly selected villages (main list and two backups) based across four altitude contours: < 800 meters, 800-1600 meters, 1600-2400 and <2400 meters.

**Procedures** 

1. *Sampling frame*: Census units reported in the 2011 census list are used as the sampling frame for the stratified sampling of villages. Each row in the excel sheet of the 2011 census classifies census units by corresponding columns of: ward name, LLG, district, province, longitude, latitude, total females, total males, number of households and total population.  We projected the population of these villages in 2019, using provincial growth rates provided by the National Statistics Office (NSO). 

2. *Altitude and sampling frame*: To identify altitude of villages in the sampling frame, we used ArcGIS to generate contour maps for PNG. Hence, raster data of Global 3D elevation model from the TanDEM-X, German aerospace center (DLR) were previously obtained, processed and corrected using spatial tools in ArcGIS. Four thresholds of contours were combined into one map: <800m, 800-1600m, 1600-2400m, and >2400m. In addition, Spatial joining tool of ArcMap was used to link the villages (census units) in the sampling frame with their contours using option "closest". 

3. *Sampling of villages*: An Excel sheet including 24,443 records of census units was generated as the final sampling frame to select the villages. A column of random numbers was generated using Rand function in Excel. The 22 categories of provinces were generated. Random numbers of rows for each category were ranked using the following Excel equation: 1+SUMPRODUCT(($AA$2:$AA$13310=AA2)*($AB$2:$AB$13310>AB2)). 

4. *Main list and backups*: For each of the 22 categories of provinces, a maximum of five villages per list was filtered using the ranked column. In addition,in the seven Highlands provinces, we filtered villages below 800m and selected another seven villages. A total of 117 selected villages was generated per list. 54% and 19% of selected villages lie in altitudes <800m and 1600-2400m, respectively. See Table 1 and Table 2.

5. *Feasibility of surveying the villages*: Accessibility of selected villages was verified using relevant data provided by Rotarians Against Malaria (RAM) for the distribution of bed nets. Among the main list, 58.4% and 17.1% of selected villages are accessible by road and trekking, respectively. Beside the Islands provinces that require flights of the survey teams, 20% of the villages in the main list needs travel by boats to access. See Table 3.

6. *Maps*: Distribution maps for selected villages by list are shown in Figures 1-3. The map shows clustering of some selected villages in parts of some provinces. Table 4 shows villages of the main (1st) list. In addition, the lists are contained in the attached excel file.
